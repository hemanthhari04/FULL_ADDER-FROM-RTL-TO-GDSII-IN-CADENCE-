 **RTL Design Observations for full_adder**

 
 **Functional Correctness**

The logic correctly implements the 1-bit full adder as per the truth table.

Sum = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin, Cout = (A & B) | (B & Cin) | (A & Cin) — both equations are logically valid.



 **Purely Combinational Design**

No clock, reset, or sequential elements are used — this is a pure combinational logic block.

The module responds immediately to input changes (ideal for synthesis and simulation).



 **Synthesis-Friendly**

The code uses only combinational logic operators (^, &, |) and is fully synthesizable.

No use of initial, always, or non-synthesizable constructs like $display.



 **No Latch Inference**

All outputs are driven by continuous assign statements; hence, no risk of unintended latches.


 **Bit-Width Clarity**

Inputs (A, B, Cin) and outputs (Sum, Cout) are all clearly declared as 1-bit wide (wire by default).



 **No Redundant Logic**

The expressions are optimized and minimal; no unnecessary gates or signals.



 **Readable and Modular**

The module is simple, reusable, and easily understandable.

Port names are intuitive and follow common naming conventions.



**Suggestions (Optional Improvements)**

Consider using a commented truth table in the code for documentation clarity.

Use parameterization only if extending to multi-bit adders.
