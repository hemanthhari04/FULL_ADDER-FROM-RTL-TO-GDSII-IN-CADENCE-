 **General RTL Design Observations**
Correctness of Logic

Logic equations and control signals are functionally correct as per the truth table or specification.

No combinational loops or undefined states are observed.

Synchronous Design

All flip-flops are triggered on the same clock edge.

No asynchronous logic unless intentionally added (like async reset).

Reset Handling

Proper reset logic (synchronous or asynchronous) is implemented.

All sequential elements initialize to a known state after reset.

No Latches

RTL is written in a way that avoids unintentional latch inference (i.e., all if/case statements are complete).

Resource Optimization

No redundant logic or unused signals.

Appropriate use of adders, multiplexers, and registers.

Readability and Modularity

Code is well-structured using modules, parameters, and naming conventions.

Each module has a single, well-defined function.

Synthesis-Friendly Code

No delays (#) or non-synthesizable constructs used in RTL.

Avoided constructs like $display, $random, or initial blocks in synthesizable modules.

Timing Awareness

Critical paths are minimized by balancing combinational logic depth between registers.

Pipelining added where necessary to improve performance.

Bit Width Management

All signals have clearly defined widths.

No mismatches in vector sizes or unintended sign extensions.

FSM Design

State encoding is clean and optimized (Binary, Gray, One-hot).

All states and transitions are clearly handled with default cases.

 Example Observation for Full Adder (Your Module)
Logic is purely combinational and correct as per full adder truth table.

All inputs and outputs are single-bit, and no clock/reset is used.

Code is synthesizable and has no latch or timing issues.

No redundant logic, and expressions are minimal using logic operators.
