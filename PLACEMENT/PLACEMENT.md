Placement is a crucial stage in the physical design of an integrated circuit where all standard cells (logic gates, flip-flops, etc.) are physically arranged on the chip's die. This process occurs after floorplanning and pre-placement and is a critical step in turning the logical circuit into a physical layout.

The Goal of Placement
The main objective is to find the optimal location for each standard cell to satisfy the design's Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) targets. The placement tool uses sophisticated algorithms to solve this complex optimization problem by considering several factors simultaneously:

Timing: Placing logically connected cells close together minimizes the length of the wires, which in turn reduces signal delay. This is essential for meeting the circuit's clock frequency requirements.

Routability: The tool must leave enough space between cells for all the necessary wires (interconnects) to be routed. A congested placement can make routing impossible.

Power: Minimizing wire length also reduces dynamic power consumption. The tool can also place cells to reduce local hot spots and improve the efficiency of the power grid.

Area: The ultimate goal is to fit the design onto the smallest possible die size, while still meeting all other constraints.

The Placement Process
The placement process is typically broken down into two main phases:

Global Placement: The tool performs an initial, rough placement of all standard cells. It ignores the detailed physical grid and simply places the cells in optimal general locations to minimize overall wire length. At this stage, cells may overlap.

Legalization (or Detailed Placement): This phase refines the global placement. The tool moves each cell to a valid, non-overlapping location on the standard cell grid. It fine-tunes the placement to meet all design rules while maintaining the quality achieved in the global placement phase.

A well-executed placement is vital for the success of the chip design. It directly impacts the final performance and is the last major opportunity to optimize the physical layout before the final routing stage begins.
